Pop<br>
Six<br>
Squish<br>
Uh uh<br>
Cicero<br>
Lipschitz<br>
And now, the six merry murderesses of the Cook County Jail<br>
In their rendition of the Cell Block Tango<br>
Cicero<br>
Lipschitz<br>
Pop<br>
Six<br>
Squish<br>
Uh uh<br>
Cicero<br>
Lipschitz<br>
Pop, six, squish, uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz<br>
Pop, six, squish, uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz<br>
Pop, six, squish, uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz<br>
He had it comin'<br>
He had it comin'<br>
He only had himself to blame<br>
If you'd have been there<br>
If you'd have seen it<br>
I betcha you would have done the same<br>
Pop, six, squish, uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz<br>
Pop, six, squish, uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz<br>
You know how people have these little habits that get you down<br>
Like Bernie<br>
Bernie, he liked to chew gum<br>
No, not chew, pop<br>
So I came home this one day<br>
And I'm really irritated<br>
And I'm looking for a little bit o' sympathy<br>
And there's Bernie lyin' on the couch, drinkin' a beer and chewin'<br>
No, not chewin'<br>
Poppin'<br>
So, I said to him, I said "You pop that gum one more time"<br>
And he did<br>
So I took the shotgun off the wall<br>
And I fired two warning shots<br>
Into his head<br>
He had it comin'<br>
He had it comin'<br>
He only had himself to blame<br>
If you'd have been there<br>
If you'd have heard it<br>
I betcha you would have done the same<br>
I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago<br>
And he told me he was single<br>
And we hit it off right away<br>
So, we started living together<br>
He'd go to work, he'd come home<br>
I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner<br>
And then I found out<br>
"Single" he told me<br>
Single, my ass<br>
Not only was he married<br>
Oh no, he had six wives<br>
One of those Mormons, you know<br>
So that night when he came home from work<br>
I fixed him his drink as usual<br>
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic<br>
He had it comin'<br>
He had it comin'<br>
He took a flower<br>
In its prime<br>
And then he used it<br>
And he abused it<br>
It was a murder<br>
But not a crime<br>
(Uh-uh, Cicero, Lipschitz)<br>
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen<br>
Carvin' up a chicken for dinner<br>
Minding my own business<br>
In storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage<br>
"You been screwin' the milkman, " he says<br>
He was crazy<br>
And he kept on screamin'<br>
"You been screwin' the milkman"<br>
And then he ran into my knife<br>
He ran into my knife ten times<br>
If you'd have been there<br>
If you'd have seen it<br>
I betcha you would have done the same!<br>
Mit kersek, en itt?<br>
Azt mondjok, hogy a hires lak√≥m lefogta a ferjemet<br>
En meg Lecsaptam a fejet<br>
De nem igaz<br>
En artatlan vagyok<br>
Nem tudom<br>
Mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tettem<br>
Probaltam<br>
A rendorsegen megmayarazni de nem ertettek meg<br>
Yeah, but did you do it?<br>
Uh uh, not guilty!<br>
My sister, Veronica and I had this double act<br>
And my husband, Charlie traveled round with us<br>
Now, for the last number in our act<br>
We did these twenty acrobatic tricks in a row<br>
One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles<br>
Back flips, flip flops<br>
One right after the other<br>
So this one night before the show we are down at the Hotel Cicero<br>
The three of us, boozin'<br>
Havin' a few laughs<br>
And we ran out of ice<br>
So I go out to get some<br>
I come back, open the door<br>
And there's Veronica and Charlie<br>
Doing number seventeen<br>
The spread eagle<br>
Well, I was in such a state of shock<br>
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing<br>
It wasn't until later<br>
When I was washing the blood off my hands<br>
I even knew they were dead<br>
They had it comin' (they had it comin')<br>
They had it comin' (they had it comin')<br>
They had it comin' all along<br>
I didn't do it (she didn't do it)<br>
But if I'd done it (but if she'd done it)<br>
How could you tell me that I was wrong?<br>
They had it comin' (they had it comin')<br>
They had it comin' (they had it comin')<br>
They had it comin' all along (they took a flower in its prime)<br>
I didn't do it (and then they used it)<br>
But if I'd done it<br>
How could you tell me that I was wrong?<br>
I loved Al Lipschitz<br>
More than I can possibly say<br>
He was a real artistic guy<br>
Sensitive, a painter<br>
But he was always trying to find himself<br>
He'd go out every night looking for himself<br>
And on the way<br>
He found Ruth<br>
Gladys<br>
Rosemary and Irving<br>
I guess you could say we broke up<br>
Because of artistic differences<br>
He saw himself as alive<br>
And I saw him dead<br>
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum<br>
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum<br>
They had it comin' (they had it comin')<br>
They had it comin' (they had it comin')<br>
They had it comin' all along<br>
'Cause if they used us ('cause if they used us)<br>
And they abused us (and they abused us)<br>
How could you tell us that we were wrong?<br>
He had it comin' (he had it comin')<br>
He had it comin' (he had it comin')<br>
He only had himself to blame (he only had himself to blame)<br>
If you'd have been there (if you'd have been there)<br>
If you'd have seen it (if you'd have seen it)<br>
I betcha you would have done the same<br>
You pop that gum one more time! Single my ass<br>
Ten times! Miert csukott Uncle Same bortonbe<br>
Number seventeen, the spread eagle<br>
Artistic differences<br>
Pop<br>
Six<br>
Squish<br>
Uh uh<br>
